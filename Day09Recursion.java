/* Hacker Rank: Day 9 - Matt Jass

Link: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-recursion

Objective:
Today, we're learning and practicing an algorithmic concept called Recursion.
Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

Task:
Write a factorial function that takes a positive integer, N as a parameter and prints the result of N! (N factorial).

Note: If you fail to use recursion or fail to name your recursive function factorial or Factorial,
you will get a score of 0.

Input Format:
A single integer, N (the argument to pass to factorial).

Constraints:
2 <= N <= 12

Your submission must contain a recursive function named factorial.

Output Format:
Print a single integer denoting N!.
