/* Hacker Rank: Day 5 - Matt Jass

Link: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-loops

Objective:
In this challenge, we're going to use loops to help us do some simple math.
Check out the Tutorial tab to learn more.

Task:
Given an integer, N, print its first 10 multiples. Each multiple N x i (where 1 <= i <= 10 )
should be printed on a new line in the form: N x i = result.

Input Format:
A single integer, N.

Constraints:
2 <= N <= 20

Output Format:
Print 10 lines of output; each line i (where 1 <= i <= 10) contains the restulf of N x i in the form:
N x i = result.
